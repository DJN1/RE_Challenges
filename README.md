# RE_Challenges
Purpose:

    A repository of introductory exercises to practice reverse engineering with help for when you get lost.

Set-Up:

    Install Oracle virtualbox then, import the Kali Linux virtualbox ova file.
  
    1. https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 
    2. https://images.offensive-security.com/virtual-images/kali-linux-2019.2-vbox-amd64.ova
    
    Start the virtual machine, Username: root && Password: toor, open a terminal and run the 
    following in the window.
    
    git clone https://github.com/ifyGecko/RE_Challenges;cd RE_Challenges;chmod +x set-up.sh;./set-up.sh

How-To-Solve:

    The proper way to finish a challenge is to use dynamic and static analysis tools to inspect each
    challenge for the correct input(s), maybe even patch the binary, to print the "Score!" message.

TODO:

1. add C++/Go challenges
2. redo/improve help files
